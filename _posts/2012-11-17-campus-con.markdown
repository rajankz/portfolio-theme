    <h4>Challenge</h4>
    <p>Students expect from campus professionals to connect with them socially in providing information regarding registration, course management, safety and academic calendar etc. Students and Alumni are already using facebook.com for keeping in touch with their classmates and to organize reunion meets. Few sites have also emerged that capitalized on the idea of a separate social network for students only, but they often restric interactions among students of a campus or even a class. The idea with Campus Connection is to design a verified social network that would allow academians to interact on a common forum. The forum should have features from common social networking sites like facebook/twitter/quora to follow topics and/or people.</p>
    
    <h4>My Role</h4>
    <p>As this was a individual effoer, I was solely responsible for interviews, idea-generation, wireframes, user testing and evetually interactive prototype.</p>
    
    <h4>Design</h4>
    <p>The home page letâ€™s you just give in your email-id (university-id if you want to create the association), and send a confirmation link to the id, to verify that it you who you claim to be. If in case you do not want to disclose your identity or association with an organization, you can always login in as Anonymous and supply any non-educational email id as well. The system does not stop you from joining if all you want was to say read the content.</p>
    <p>If you have logged in with an id, that is not the default for that university (even if you belong to the said university), your comments/posts will be automatically marked as something that belongs to an outsider.  This is needed to protect all the people who might falsely trust a well-crafted post or message.
You can always check or uncheck the list of universities added to your group-list to show or hide the posts and messages from that university.
When you make a post, you can select as to which forum you are planning to post it. This is supplied as a drop-down selection box just below the create-post text area. The comments on any post are visible once you click the post to slide down the comments section.</p>
